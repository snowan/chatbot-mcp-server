    "summary": "Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we work with information\nacross disciplines and practical contexts. A growing range of disciplines are\nnow involved in studying, developing, and assessing the use of AI in practice,\nbut these disciplines often employ conflicting understandings of what AI is and\nwhat is involved in its use. New, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to\nbridge competing conceptualisations of AI in practice and help shape the future\nof AI use. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which\nmodels key decisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary\nperspectives. The AI Thinking model addresses five practice-based competencies\ninvolved in applying AI in context: motivating AI use in information processes,\nformulating AI methods, assessing available tools and technologies, selecting\nappropriate data, and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts it is used\nin. A hypothetical case study is provided to illustrate the application of AI\nThinking in practice. This article situates AI Thinking in broader\ncross-disciplinary discourses of AI, including its connections to ongoing\ndiscussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation. AI Thinking can help\nto bridge divides between academic disciplines and diverse contexts of AI use,\nand to reshape the future of AI in practice.",
